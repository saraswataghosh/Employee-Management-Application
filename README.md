This project is all about helping an organization manage its employees in an organized and easy way. It works like a small office system where you can keep track of workers, their basic details, and their roles. Instead of writing everything on paper, this system lets you store and manage employee information in one place.

It allows the user to add new employees, update their details, remove employees who have left, and view all the people currently working. It’s designed to make managing a group of employees simpler, quicker, and more efficient.
